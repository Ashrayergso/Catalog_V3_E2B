Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schema**: All files will share a common data schema for the product information. This schema will include fields such as product name, description, product number, vendor name, cost, product image, and link to a product site.

2. **Function Names**: The backend files will share function names for CRUD operations and export functionalities. These might include functions like `create_product()`, `read_product()`, `update_product()`, `delete_product()`, and `export_product_list()`.

3. **Streamlit Components**: The frontend file `streamlit_app.py` will use Streamlit components that might be referenced in the CSS file for styling. These could include components like `st.image`, `st.text`, `st.dataframe`, etc.

4. **CSS Selectors**: The `styles.css` file will contain CSS selectors that correspond to HTML elements in the Streamlit app. These might include selectors like `.stImage`, `.stText`, `.stDataframe`, etc.

5. **Python Libraries**: All Python files will share common Python libraries such as `streamlit`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy` for database operations, and possibly others for specific functionalities like web scraping for the search feature.

6. **Deployment Instructions**: The `deployment_script.py` will contain instructions that are referenced in the `user_manual.md`. These might include commands for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and starting the application.

7. **Database Connection**: The `database.py` file will establish a connection to the database that will be used in `crud_operations.py`, `export_functionality.py`, and `search_feature.py` for various database operations.

8. **Search Feature**: The `search_feature.py` will contain a function for searching product alternatives online that might be used in `streamlit_app.py` to display the search results.
